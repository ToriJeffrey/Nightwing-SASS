He is the first character to assume the role of Batman's crime-fighting partner, Robin, and is the leader of the teen titans. Dick Grayson was an acrobat at a traveling circus, where he performed with his parents and siblings, known as the "Flying Graysons". Tragedy struck when the circus was targeted by the notorious crime lord Tony Zucco, who had the Graysons killed in order to silence their testimony against him. <br><br>Witnessing the murder of his family, a young Dick Grayson was taken in by Bruce Wayne, who trained him to become the first Robin.As Robin, Grayson fought alongside Batman in Gotham city, taking down notorious criminals such as the Joker and the Riddler. However, as he grew older and more skilled, he began to chafe under Batman's strict rules and regulations. Eventually, he decided to strike out on his own and adopted the identity of Nightwing. As Nightwing, Grayson continued to fight crime in Gotham City and later in Bludhaven.</p>
