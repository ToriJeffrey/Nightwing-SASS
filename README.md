## Nightwing fact page

I recently learnt about the existence of SASS and wanted to practice using it compared to regular CSS. I tried mainly implementing variables and nesting throughout even if they weren't necessarily needed. I struggled with the design and layout of this one. Primarily with the biography paragraphs and image slotted next to them. So I haven't been able to finish the responsive layout past 1030px (approx). I may revisit this project.
